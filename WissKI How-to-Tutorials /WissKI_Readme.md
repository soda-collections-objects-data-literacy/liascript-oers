# SODa WissKI Bits Tutorial

Join us to explore ontology-driven research data modeling with WissKI 

[ISWC 2025 - The 24th International Semantic Web Conference](https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/)

Date: November 2-6,  2025

Location: Nara Prefectural Convention Center,  Japan


## Short Abstract

Guided by the [TaDiRAH](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH) taxonomy, drawing on learning objectives [Learning Objectives Matrix of RDM](https://zenodo.org/records/15025246), and powered by Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, CIDOC CRM), participants will model real-world cultural heritage entities, link open data, and publish interoperable knowledge graphs using [WissKI](https://wiss-ki.eu/) (Wissenschaftliche Kommunikationsinfrastruktur).

Whether you are working on your own dataset or simply curious about the [WissKI](https://wiss-ki.eu/) Linked Data infrastructure — this is your opportunity to learn, experiment, and connect with peers.

## Target Group

Researcher, Data Steward, Ontology Engineer.

The tutorial is aimed at ontology engineers, knowledge graph developers, GLAM and digital humanities researchers, as well as data stewards, curators, trainers, and research data infrastructure providers. 

We expect 25 participants with diverse backgrounds in semantic technologies and applied data modeling.

Participants should have a basic understanding of RDF, OWL, or knowledge graphs, do not need prior experience with [WissKI](https://wiss-ki.eu/), and are expected to bring their own laptops.

## Teaching Strategy

**Demonstrative Learning**, **Learning by Doing**, and **Modeling form** together form an effective trio for software-based OERs: learners see real application steps, understand the processes behind them and try out what is shown for themselves. 

This promotes sustainable action competence, especially with complex digital tools from WissKI to SPARQL editors.

## Learning Objectives

This module introduces key activities in the Digital Humanities – from interpretation and modeling to the publication of structured data.

Using WissKI and the Erlangen CRM, participants engage in hands-on practice and reflect on their methods through the lens of the [TaDiRAH](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH) taxonomy.

**Participants will learn...**

* [Interpreting](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/page/interpreting): Interpret an existing WissKI collection portal and analyse on its conceptual and methodological structure.
* [Capturing](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/page/capturing): Capture and structure metadata based on CIDOC CRM with Protegé.
* [Modeling](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/page/modeling): Apply ontology-driven modeling techniques using WissKI Pathbuilder.
* [Creating](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/page/creating): Develop WissKI instances and define semantic groups and paths using draw.io to pathbuilder tool pipeline.
* [Enriching](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/page/enriching): Enrich existing datasets with semantic links, external vocabularies, and authority data.
* [Web Developing](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/page/webDevelopment): Conduct structured data analysis with SPARQL in the WissKI environment.

**Learners are...** [for details see LZM](https://zenodo.org/records/15025246) 

Interpreting

* evaluate the suitability of different database systems for a specific research project (LZ-ID 02_010_0407)
* apply an appropriate data curation concept that takes into account semantic modeling and the FAIR principles (LZ-ID 02_016_0567).

Capturing

* name (LZ-ID 03_003_0646) and explain (LZ-ID 03_003_0647) metadata standards.
* independently analyze metadata standards (LZ-ID 03_003_0657).
* apply metadata standards under guidance (LZ-ID 03_003_0659).
* define the term “controlled vocabulary” (LZ-ID 03_005_0695)
* describe areas of application for controlled vocabularies (LZ-ID 03_005_0696).

Modeling

* use ontologies to describe resources (LZ-ID 03_007_0780).
* use WissKI Pathbuilder to model groups and paths (new).

Creating

* use draw.io to represent semantic groups and paths (new).
* export ontology diagram as XML files from draw.io (new).
* using the gnm_service conversion tool (new).
* import Pathbuilder XML into WissKI (new).
* verify groups and paths (new).

Enrichng

* name examples of authority data (03_005_0720).
* identify quality criteria for controlled vocabularies (LZ-ID 03_005_0717).
* explain quality criteria for controlled vocabularies (LZ-ID 03_005_0718).

Web Development
* Learners are able to apply database queries (02_010_0403).

## Speaker

The tutorial is led by **Dr. Canan Hastik** (Interessensgemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbeitung e.V., c.hastik@igsd-ev.de), a research expert in structured and graph data analysis, research data management (RDM), and digital/data science, with a focus on the Digital Humanities and scientific object collections. She holds a PhD from the Institute for Language & Literature Studies at TU Darmstadt (2019), following a master’s degree in Information Science & Engineering and a diploma in Information & Knowledge Management with a specialization in library science.

Her research centers on heterogeneous data integration, semantic infrastructures, and ontology-driven modeling, as well as the development of didactically grounded Open Educational Resources (OERs) for FAIR data publication, research data management, data literacy, and data science. She has led and contributed to numerous national and international projects in the fields of digital humanities, education, and library and information science.

## SODa Project and Contact

[SODa – Sammlungen, Objekte und Datenkompetenzen](https://sammlungen.io/) is a German national initiative that strengthens data literacy and research data management (RDM) skills for professionals working with academic collections. The project focuses on developing FAIR, open educational resources (OERs) tailored to collection-based research and digital scholarship.

SODa supports structured, interdisciplinary learning around data practices in the context of cultural heritage and research infrastructures. Its modular resources cover topics such as collection development, metadata and ontology modeling, semantic enrichment, data visualization, and digital documentation.

Learning designs are based on coherent [SODa personas](https://zenodo.org/records/15574575) and a learning objectives matrix for RDM, supporting both foundational knowledge and discipline-specific needs. 

Research-based and problem-oriented learning approaches encourage active engagement, practical application, and reuse across academic and heritage institutions.

SODa also fosters exchange and collaboration across communities through contributions to national initiatives such as the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and promotes standards, good practices, and innovative workflows in semantic data modeling.

SODa is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and NextGenerationEU under funding code 16DKZ2016B.
